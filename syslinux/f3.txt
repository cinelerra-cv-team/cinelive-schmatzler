==  Tweaks for the boot commandline ==

To boot with default values just press ENTER.

=== Media tweaks ===

livemedia=/dev/sdX => Tell the init script which partition
  contains the Slackware Live OS you want to boot. This can
  become necessary if you have another copy of Slackware Live
  installed in another partition.  Also accepted: UUID or LABEL.

livemain=directoryname => Use this if you copied the content
  of the ISO to a different directory than "liveslak".

nop => No persistence, i.e. boot the virgin installation in 
  case your "persistence" directory got corrupted. 
 
persistence=directoryname => Use this if you want to use
  a different directory than "persistence" for storing
  persistent data.

toram => copy the OS from the media to to RAM before running it.
  You can remove the boot media after booting.
