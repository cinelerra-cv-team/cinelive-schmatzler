==  Tweaks for the boot commandline ==

=== Hardware related ===

localhd => initialize RAID/LVM on local hard drives.

nga => no glamor 2D acceleration.  Use when X.Org fails
  with error "EGL_MESA_drm_image required".

nomodeset => Boot without kernel mode setting, needed with
  some machines.

rootdelay=10 => Add 10 second delay to give the kernel more
  time to initialize USB. Try this if booting fails. Default is 5.

swap => Allow the Live OS to activate all swap partitions on
  the local hardware. By default, no swap is touched.

=== Troubleshooting ===

blacklist=mod1[,mod2[...]]  => Add one or more kernel modules
  to the kernel blacklist to prevent them from loading, in case
  they cause issues during operation.

debug => During init, pause at strategic locations while
  assembling the overlay filesystem and show mount information.

rescue => After initialization, you will be dropped in a
  rescue shell to perform lowlevel maintenance.
