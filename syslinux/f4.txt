==  Tweaks for the boot commandline ==

=== Hardware related ===

nomodeset => Boot without kernel mode setting, needed with
  some machines.

rootdelay=10 => Add 10 second delay to give the kernel more
  time to initialize USB. Try this if booting fails.

swap => Allow the Live OS to activate all swap partitions on
  on the local hardware. By default, none is touched.

=== Troubleshooting ===

blacklist=mod1[,mod2[...]]  => Add one or more kernel modules
  to the kernel blacklist to prevent them from loading, in case
  they cause issues during operation.

debug => During init, pause at specifiuc locations while as-
  sembling the overlay filesystem and show mount information.

rescue => After initialization, you will be dropped in a
  rescue shell to perform lowlevel maintenance.
