==  Tweaks for the boot commandline ==

To boot with default values just press ENTER.

=== Desktop Environment ===

0|1|2|3|4|5|6|S|s|single => Select a runlevel to start with. 
  The default is 4 for graphical login. 
 
kbd=fr xkb=ch,fr => Example of custom X keyboard layout.
 
livepw="somestring" => Change the password for user "live".

locale=nl_NL kbd=nl tz=Europe/Amsterdam => Example of language, 
  keyboard and/or timezone customization. 
 
rootpw="somestring" => Change the password for user "root".

=== Custom software ===

load=nvidia => Load and configure Nvidia drivers if available 
  in the ISO. 
 
load=mod1[,mod2[...]] => Load one or more squashfs modules
  from the directory: "/liveslack/optional".
  By default none of these modules is loaded on boot.

noload=mod1[,mod2[...]] => Prevent loading of one or more
  squashfs modules from the directory "/liveslack/addons".
  By default all these modules are loaded on boot.

=== Hardware related ===

nomodeset => Boot without kernel mode setting, needed with 
  some machines. 
 
rootdelay=10 => Add 10 second delay to give the kernel more 
  time to initialize USB. Try this if booting fails.

swap => Allow the Live OS to activate all swap partitions on
  on the local hardware. By default, none is touched.

=== Media tweaks ===

livemedia=/dev/sdX => Tell the init script which partition
  contains the Slackware Live OS you want to boot. This can
  become necessary if you have another copy of Slackware Live
  installed in another partition.

livemain=directoryname => Use this if you copied the content
  of the ISO to a different directory than "liveslak".

nop => No persistence, i.e. boot the virgin installation in 
  case your "persistence" directory got corrupted. 
 
persistence=directoryname => Use this if you want to use
  a different directory than "persistence" for storing
  persistent data.

toram => copy the OS from the media to to RAM before running it.
  You can remove the boot media after booting.

=== Troubleshooting ===

blacklist=mod1[,mod2[...]]  => Add one or more kernel modules
  to the kernel blacklist to prevent them from loading, in case
  they cause issues during operation.

debug => During init, pause at specifiuc locations while as-
  sembling the overlay filesystem and show mount information.

rescue => After initialization, you will be dropped in a
  rescue shell to perform lowlevel maintenance.
